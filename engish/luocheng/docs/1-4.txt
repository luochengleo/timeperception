Sleep is an integral part of being healthy. Lack of sleep causes harmful physiological effects ranging from simple skin problems to serious health complications like heart disease and stroke. Although sleep needs vary from person to person and across species, the complete absence of it is fatal. An experiment on rats found that depriving them entirely of sleep resulted in their death within 11-32 days.[2] Despite research such as this, there isn’t any scientific evidence that prove the physiological causes of death by sleep deprivation.
In fact, in the rat sleep deprivation experiment, it is not entirely clear whether sleep was what caused the deaths. It is possible the methods used to keep the rats awake, an electric shock, was what killed them. A recent 2013 study on mice, however, may have found the first scientific evidence proving the physiological importance of sleep.
“We here report that sleep has a critical function in ensuring metabolic homeostasis…the restorative function of sleep may be a consequence of the enhanced removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in the awake central nervous system.” [1] The findings suggest sleep helps the brain get rid of toxins. With further examination, they have found that the mechanism behind this garbage collection lies in glial cells’ fluid control over cerebrospinal fluid. The brain’s glial cells expand when awake which block fluid flow and contract when asleep allowing the fluid to carry debris out of the brain into the liver for disposal. Surprisingly, pieces of protein that cause Alzheimer’s disease are among those flushed out of the mice’ brain. Many scientist were shocked by the results of this experiment and led some to redefine their views on the significance of sleep. Not only does it prove the importance of sleep, it also may revolutionize the future of Alzheimer’s disease treatment.
